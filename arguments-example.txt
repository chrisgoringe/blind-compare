--directory = /path/to/folder/with/images

--match = xxx      # The pattern found in the filename of the base image in each set
# --keypad         # Use the keypad layout to select images
# --scorelist      # Default is just to choose one image. With scorelist, enter a sequence, ending with space (or when all have been chosen)

###
#
# For sort mode 
# Sort mode shows one image at a time, and moves it to a subdirectory with the name given by the key pressed
# Keys permitted are 'zxcvbnm123456789'
#
###

# --sort_mode

#
# Layout - optional - the defaults are normally good

# --perrow = n     # Number of images to show per row
# --height = 800   # Height of app

# Advanced options
#
###

# --sub = yyy,zzz  # One or more patterns that replace xxx in other images of the same set. Normally automated.
# --rmatch = regex # A regex that is used instead of match to identify base image (match still used for replacements) eg ^0 to only match at start
--verbose 1        # setting to 2 will give spoilers, 1 gives some info
