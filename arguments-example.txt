# Required for all runs:
  
--directory = /path/to/folder/with/images

# Optional for all runs:

# --height = 800   # Height of app in pixel
# --recurse        # look in subdirectories

# Required for AB comparison:

--match = xxx    # The pattern found in the filename of the base image in each set
--sub = yyy,zzz  # One or more patterns that replace xxx in other images of the same set
                        
# Optional for AB comparison:

# --rmatch = regex # A regex that is used instead of match to identify base image (match still used for replacements) eg ^0 to only match at start
# --perrow = n     # Number of images to show per row (default 3)
# --keypad         # Use the keypad layout to select images
# --scorelist      # Default is just to choose one image. With scorelist, enter a sequence, ending with space (or when all have been chosen)
# --verbose n      # setting to 2 will give spoilers

# Required for sort model

# --sort_mode        # Show one image at a time, and sort into folder using 'Z' and 'M' (any other key leaves image unmoved)
# --sort_z z_dir     # Directory (relative to --directory) to move 'z' images to
# --sort_m m_dir     # Directory (relative to --directory) to move 'm' images to
